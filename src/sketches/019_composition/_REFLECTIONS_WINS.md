# Reflections: 019_composition

--------------------------------
## I Got To The Music
- prioritized completion over implementation elegance
- high signal to noise ratio for lessons:
    - found many friction points, some worse than others and some acceptable
    - things can sound good even if they are "incorrect"
- everything I've built is fully mine
    - I have my own sonic signature! NOBODY CAN MAKE WHAT I MAKE

--------------------------------
## It is ACTUALLY music!
- I didn't such DAW-comparable results

--------------------------------
## FDN sounds great, even if colourful
- what is theoretically a flaw is sonically inspiring for synthesis
- sounds like a plate reverb or something
- can be used as a harmonically-tuned resonator
- turns boring sounds into interesting ones
- I still could benefit from an additional colorless reverb

**Big Techno Kick**
- BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM

**Lush Nostalgic Chords and Pads**
- oh my GOD this was amazing

**Metalic Cymbals**
- really pleased with the way this worked out

**Lots More Potential**
- longer delay times could be useful for wild spacial decomposition
- especially with modulation of delay times
- peq in fb path could help with drum synthesis
